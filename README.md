Question 1: Suppose you have a list of names and corresponding ages. You want to create a HashMap where the name is the key and the age is the value. Write code to create the HashMap and add the following entries to it:


Question 2: Suppose you have a HashMap that maps student names to their grades. You want to find the average grade for all students in the HashMap. Write code to calculate the average grade.

Question 3: Suppose you have a HashMap that maps stock symbols to their current prices. You want to find the stock with the highest price. Write code to find the stock symbol with the highest price
                    

Question 4: Suppose you have a HashMap that maps employee names to their salaries. You want to give a 5% raise to all employees who earn less than $50,000 per year. Write code to update the salaries in the HashMap.

Question 5: Suppose you have a HashMap that maps words to the number of times they appear in a document. You want to find the top 10 most frequent words. Write code to find the top 10 most frequent words.

Question 6: Suppose you have an ArrayList of integers. Write code to sort the ArrayList in ascending order

Question 7: Suppose you have a HashSet of strings. Write code to sort the strings in descending order and store them in a new ArrayList.

Question 8: Suppose you have a TreeMap that maps strings to integers. Write code to sort the entries in the TreeMap by their values in descending order and store them in a new LinkedHashMap.

Question 9: Suppose you have a LinkedList of custom objects that have a "name" field of type String. Write code to sort the LinkedList in alphabetical order by the "name" field.

Question 10: Suppose you have a PriorityQueue of integers. Write code to sort the integers in descending order and store them in a new ArrayList.


Question 11: Suppose you have a list of strings list and you want to sort it in ascending order. Write a code snippet using the Collections class that sorts the list.


Question 12: Suppose you have a list of integers list and you want to find the maximum value in the list. Write a code snippet using the Collections class that finds the maximum value.

Question 13: Suppose you have a list of integers list and you want to shuffle the order of the elements. Write a code snippet using the Collections class that shuffles the list.
                   
Question 14: Suppose you have a map of strings to integers map and you want to sort it in descending order by value. Write a code snippet using the Collections class that sorts the map.

Question 15: Suppose you have a class Person with fields name and age. Write a Comparator implementation that sorts Person objects by age in ascending order.
                 
Question 16: Suppose you have a class Employee with fields name, id, and salary. Write a Comparable implementation for Employee that sorts by id in ascending order.

Question 17: Suppose you have a class Book with fields title, author, and price. Write a Comparator implementation that sorts Book objects by author in alphabetical order, and then by price in descending order.
